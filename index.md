The shell is a program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.

There are many reasons to learn about the shell.

- For most bioinformatics tools, you have to use the shell. There is no graphical interface. If you want to work in metagenomics or genomics you're going to need to use the shell.
- The shell gives you power. The command line gives you the power to do your work more efficiently and more quickly. When you need to do things tens to hundreds of times, knowing how to use the shell is transformative.
- To use remote computers or cloud computing, you need to use the shell.

> ## Getting Started
>
> Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
> their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
> workflow. <br>**These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools.**
>
> #### Prerequisites
>
> Workshop participants should follow the instructions on the [workshop homepage](https://liz-is.github.io/2018-01-29-maxplanck/) to set up their computers. For this lesson, you will need a Bash shell and [this file](data/for_shell.zip).
